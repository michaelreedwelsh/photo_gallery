This is a photo gallery that I am coding for a project on Treehouse. It uses some basic JQuery to contruct and append a lightbox for displaying the images. It is getting pushed up to Github far before it's finished so that I can continue working on it from other machines. 

The end product will probably (hopefully?) be much better than what is currently visible.
